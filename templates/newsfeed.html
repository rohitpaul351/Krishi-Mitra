                <p class="news-date">May 11, 2023</p>
                <p class="news-content">It’s late May and the field is glowing with fragrant purple as the women in their flowing shalwar kameez arrive with scythes to harvest the lavender. In the 30-odd villages on the hilly slopes of Jammu’s Doda district, more than 200 farmers have shifted from maize to lavender production, starting a “purple revolution” in the region.

                  The village of Lehrote had a moment of agricultural fame this year when a 43-year-old farmer, Bharat Bhushan, won a prestigious award for innovative farming from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, one of several institutions across the country looking to find ways of coping with the climate crisis and its devastating impact on farming. Lavender, a drought-resistant crop, can be grown on poor soil and likes lots of sun but needs little water.</p>

                <p class="news-date">May 10, 2023</p>
                <p class="news-content">India’s horticulture sector has proven to be more profitable and productive than the agricultural sector and has emerged as a rapidly growing industry. According to the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), India ranks second in fruits and vegetable production in the world after China. The country's advantage lies in being a low-cost producer of fruits and vegetables because of a combination of factors such as favourable agro-climatic conditions, availability of labour, and low input costs. As a result, fruits and vegetables account for almost 90% of the total horticulture production in the country.</p>
